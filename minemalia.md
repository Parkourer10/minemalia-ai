## Revive Beacons

Revive beacons are used to revive a player so that they don't have to wait for their death ban to be over. There are 4 types of revive beacons, all can be found in crates at **/warp crates**.

Each type of beacon has it's own specifications, such as revive time, cooldown and durability. One of them has a special effect too.

**-** Revive time is the time taken after the beacon is placed, for it to actually revive the player.

**-** Cooldown is the time you must wait in between using a beacon of a certain type.

**-** Durability is the amount of times your beacon (which is a custom head block) can be broken by someone before it is destroyed and cancelled.

**The revive beacons are the following:**

1. Revive Beacon Tier I - Revive time: 120 Seconds \| Cooldown: 2 Hours \| Durability: 5 Breaks
2. Revive Beacon Tier II - Revive time: 90 Seconds \| Cooldown: 2.5 Hours \| Durability: 5 Breaks
3. Revive Beacon Tier III - Revive time: 60 Seconds \| Cooldown: 3 Hours \| Durability: 5 Breaks
4. Revive Beacon Ghost - Revive time: 5 Minutes \| Cooldown: 6 Hours \| Durability: 1 Break

Each of the revive beacons will broadcast the location upon usage, such that everyone can find it and attempt to destroy it. However, the ghost revive beacon has a special effect in which it won't broadcast the location and thus makes it the most rare out of all the beacons since it can silently revive a player, though it has the weakest durability and longest revive time/cooldown.

To use a revive beacon, you must put it in your main hand and bind it to a player that is currently dead/has a death ban already. To do so, you should use **/bind \[player\]**.

## Lifesteal Commands

Players have access to 2 special lifesteal commands, they are the following:

**-****/lifesteal revive \[player\]** \- Sacrifice 10 hearts to revive a certain player with an ongoing death ban, cooldown 24 hours.

**-****/lifesteal check \[player\]** \- Check some information about a player, such as banned, ban time and hearts amount.

## Shop

The shop in lifesteal is much more limited than other servers due to it's hardcore aspect. Since there are no claims, you will most likely not buy some decoration for a house build since you may find it raided the next day, thus the shop is mostly focused on combat, miscellaneous items and selling resources to make money.

In the 1.20 update of Lifesteal, armor trims and more 1.20 additions are now available in the shop!

## Replant

Replant is a feature that will make grinding easier for players who like farming. It can be toggled using **/replant** and will automatically replant fully grown harvested crops.

## Auctions

Auctions is a known feature and is present in this lifesteal server. You can set items up for auction and other players will be able to buy it from the auction house. You can do so by using **/ah sell \[price\]** and other players will be able to open **/ah** and buy it if they want it/need it.

## Chunk Hoppers

A chunk hopper is used to collect all the drops within an entire chunk. You can check the chunk borders visually by toggling this using F3+G to know where to place your chunk hoppers.

## Mines

The prison server features mines all the way from A to Prestige 20. To get started, you should go mine in **/warp a**to gain tokens and sell your blocks using the **sell signs** to get money to rank up. Most blocks in the game will be found in the mines while some others are available at the server shop. When you have enough money to rank up, you can do so by using **/rankup** and then use the proper command to teleport to every new mine, for example **/warp b**or check all the mines using**/mines**

In the next paragraph we will explain the usage of tokens, which can be obtained in multiple ways.

## Tokens

Tokens are used to upgrade your pickaxe and other items with custom enchants to make them more powerful, adding multiple abilities such as speed, night vision, haste and more. For example, the excavation enchant will allow you to mine a 3x3x3 area by just mining the middle block.

**Notes:**

1. You can gain tokens by mining in the mines, you will get 10 tokens for each 250 blocks broken. You can also gain tokens by killing bosses or getting lucky blocks in the mines.
2. Excavation and other similar explosive enchants only count the middle block as mined, so you won't gain more tokens with that custom enchant.
3. Only custom enchants are refundable, meaning that if you add fortune 30 for example you cannot refund it however enchants such as excavation, tile, sphered etc can be refunded using **/te refund \[enchant\] \[levels\]**

## Bosses

The prison server contains 5 extremely powerful bosses that spawn every few hours and can be fought at **/warp boss** where PVP is disabled.

The 5 top damagers have a chance to money, tokens, blocks and some other rewards while other players who could not make it to the top 5 in damage will only receive a small participation reward.

The 5 bosses are the following:

1. Destroyer Zombie
2. Eternal Vindicator
3. Prime Piglin
4. Ancestral Wither Skeleton
5. Arcane Husk

## Plots

The prison server features a world dedicated for player plots. Every player is allowed to claim a plot, and once reaching the **FREE**rank you will gain access to a second plot. You can use the plots to store your items, create shops using ChestShops, or build something nice!

## Enchantments

The prison server features some vanilla enchantments that go up to level 30 and a few custom enchantments meant for PvP. To check them out, place an item in your main hand and do **/enchant** to have a look at the respective menu, the prices are in tokens.

## Talismans

Talismans in the game provide various buffs when you keep them in your inventory. Only three talismans can be active at the same time. Talismans do not stack. Here are some examples how they work:

### Talismans not stacking example

The amount of talismans of the same type does not matter.

- 3x Strength 3 = 1x Strength 3 (9% increase in damage dealt)
- 1x Strength 1 + 1x Strength 2 + 1x Strength 3 = 1x Strength 3 (9% increase in damage dealt)

### Combining Talismans

Combining different types of talismans can result in additional buffs:

- 1x Sharpness 3 + 1x Strength 3 = 18% increase in damage dealt
- 3x Sharpness 3 + 3x Strength 3 = 1x Sharpness 3 + 1x Strength 3 (18% increase in damage dealt)
- 1x Strength 1 + 1x Strength 2 + 1x Strength 3 + 1x Sharpness 1 + 1x Sharpness 2 + 1x Sharpness 3 = 1x Sharpness 3 + 1x Strength 3 (18% increase in damage dealt)

### More Than Two Talismans

For setups with more than two talismans, the effects are as follows:

- 1x Boss 3 + 1x Strength 3 + 1x Sharpness 3 = 1x Boss 3 + 1x Strength 3 + 1x Sharpness 3 (33% increase in damage dealt to bosses)
- 1x Resistance 3 + 1x Strength 3 + 1x Sharpness 3 = 1x Resistance 3 + 1x Strength 3 + 1x Sharpness 3 (12% decrease in incoming damage & 18% increase in damage dealt)

### More Than Three Talismans

Keeping more than 3 different types of talismans in your inventory is tricky as only three talismans are active at the same time. It is not always certain which talismans will be active, so to avoid being surprised do not more than 3 talismans in your inventory.

## Auction House

Players can sell a variety of items and stuff on the auction house for a specific price, the limit is 4 items per player.

## Claims

A claim is a piece of land owned by a certain player. In order to claim land you must get the golden shovel claim tool from /kit claimtool , then you should select 2 opposite corners of a square to claim the land, it will extend on all the height of the chunk from the lowest Y level to the highest automatically.

Alternatively, you can stand in the middle of where you want to claim land and use the command **/claim \[radius\]**, you can claim land based on the amount of claimblocks you have to use so keep that in mind.

If you use the command to claim, you would do /claim 15 in order to claim a 31x31 claim for example.

## PlayerWarps

To enhance the interaction of our players with each others we decided to provided PlayerWarps as the ability for players to create their own warps and add them to specific categories, whether that would be shop, xp farm, building and other. You can gain access to set a PlayerWarp using a voucher obtained from the vote crates.

## Custom Enchants

Custom enchants allow for special abilities and perks to be added on tools and weapons etc. You can add up to 7 custom enchants per item, alongside trackers and protection scrolls.

There are 9 special custom enchant items:

1. White Scroll - Protects your item in case a low success rate custom enchant book fails.
2. Magic Dust - Used to increase the success rate of custom enchant books.
3. Black Scroll - Used to extract a custom enchant from an item, with exception to some custom enchants.
4. Randomization Scroll - Used to reroll the success and destroy rates of a custom enchant book.

### When does the Topvoter Competition happen?

The Topvoter Competition is a monthly competition that runs alongside the Voting Lottery. It starts at the beginning of each month in the CET timezone and lasts the entire month.

### How does the Topvoter Competition work?

The top 5 players with the highest number of votes accumulated throughout the month will win store coupons. You can increase your votes by voting twice a day on platforms that allow voting every 12 hours. Winners will be announced at the end of the month on our Discord server.

### What are the rewards for the Topvoter Competition?

The top 5 voters will receive the following store coupons: €50, €40, €30, €20, and €10. These coupons can be used to gift someone else a rank, and they are valid for one-time use, expiring usually within one week.

### When does the Voting Lottery happen?

The Voting Lottery is also a monthly competition running alongside the Topvoter Competition, starting at the beginning of each month in the CET timezone and ending at the month's conclusion.

### How does the Voting Lottery work?

Each vote you cast counts as one lottery ticket, so the more votes you make, the higher your chances of winning. Even a single vote enters you into the draw. At the end of the month, nine random winners are drawn and announced on our Discord server.

### What are the rewards for the Voting Lottery?

The lottery offers 9 prizes: 3x rank upgrades, 3x €10 coupons to use on anything, and 3x €15 boosters. Coupon codes can be used to gift rank upgrades or boosters, and each coupon can only be used once, typically expiring within one week.
